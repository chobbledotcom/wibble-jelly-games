/**
 * End-to-end proof that the mutation tester actually works: it spawns real

 * test gaps are caught while clean tests pass.
 *
 * Each case writes its fixtures to its own throwaway temp dir (outside test/,
 * so the code-quality scanners never see these deliberately-weak tests) and
 * invokes the real `runMutationTesting` — the same code path the CLI uses.
