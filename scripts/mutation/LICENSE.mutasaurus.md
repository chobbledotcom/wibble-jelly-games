# Mutasaurus attribution

The mutation-operator tables in `operators.js` and the binary/assignment
expression walking strategy in `generate.js` are derived from Mutasaurus
(`@mutasaurus/mutasaurus`, https://github.com/christoshrousis/mutasaurus),
used here under the MIT licence reproduced below.

Our runner intentionally diverges from upstream in one critical place: upstream
writes each mutated file into a temporary working directory but then runs the
*original* test files, which (in a project that imports source through import
aliases such as `#lib/...`) resolve back to the unmutated source — so every
mutant survives. Our runner mutates the source file in place, runs the mapped
tests, and restores it, so mutations actually bind through the aliases.
